This package contains a demonstration version of DOCUFILE_TS.accdb, a Microsoft Access 
application that can read and catalog image files (scanned documents, photos, etc.) in 
a database. DOCUFILE_TS requires OCR-Tesseract to convert image files to text. The
application looks for specific text, stores it in a database and moves the file to a 
specified location for storage.
